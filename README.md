# Tableau Visualizations - README

This README file explains the Tableau visualizations saved as **bar_chart.png** and **histogram_2004.png**.

## Files

1. **bar_chart.png**
   - **Description**: This image shows a bar chart created in Tableau.
   - **Data**: The chart displays data for the year 2004, categorized by various country names or regional entities.
   - **Measure**: The Y-axis represents the **SUM(2004)** metric, indicating the total sum for each country or region.
   - **Insights**: The chart helps compare the values across different countries or regions for 2004, providing a visual representation of their respective sizes.

2. **histogram_2004.png**
   - **Description**: This image shows a histogram created in Tableau.
   - **Data**: The histogram visualizes the **Count of 2004** data values, grouped into bins (intervals) to show the frequency distribution.
   - **Bins**: The X-axis shows **2004 (bin)** values ranging up to 6,500 million (or 6.5 billion), and the Y-axis shows the **count of 2004 values** within each bin.
   - **Insights**: The histogram helps illustrate how the values for 2004 are distributed, showing that most values are concentrated in the lower bins, with fewer observations in the higher ranges.

## Usage
These images can be used to analyze the distribution and sum of data for 2004 across different categories. The **bar_chart.png** is useful for direct comparisons between entities, while the **histogram_2004.png** provides insights into the overall distribution of values.
